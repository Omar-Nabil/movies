I developed a Movies Website using Angular and The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It features user authentication with login and signup pages, a homepage displaying popular movies, and a movies page with pagination and search functionality. Additionally, the TV shows page includes pagination and a search feature. The project demonstrates my expertise in Angular, API integration, authentication, and UIUX design, enhancing the user experience with dynamic content and seamless navigation.
